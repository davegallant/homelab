# Kubernetes security and network policy

Review [Cilium values](apps/cilium/values.yaml), workload policy manifests,
namespace labels and Argo AppProjects for intended boundaries. Inspect live
resources to establish enforcement; a tracked deny rule alone is insufficient.

- Cilium endpoint policies do not isolate host-network workloads or traffic
  inside userspace Tailscale/Newt tunnels. Test those paths separately.
- Scope policies narrowly in shared platform namespaces; a namespace-wide deny
  can disrupt unrelated controllers. Test fresh NFS mounts as node traffic.
- Pod Security exceptions require explicit review. Check container privileges
  separately from namespace admission labels.
- Validate required application traffic and denied LAN/API traffic after policy
  changes, including fresh connections and restarted pods.
- Use Hubble events for endpoint attribution; scrape-target metric labels do
  not necessarily identify flow sources or destinations.

See [Cilium operations](apps/cilium/README.md),
[qBittorrent egress limits](apps/qbittorrent-egress/README.md), and
[hardening guidance](HARDENING.md).
